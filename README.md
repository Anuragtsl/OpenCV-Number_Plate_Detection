# OpenCV-Number_Plate_Detection

In this project, I use OpenCV in python to detect Number plate of vehicles.

# Workflow

Step #1: Detect and localize a license plate in an input image/frame.

Step #2: Extract the characters from the license plate.

Step #3: Apply some form of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the extracted characters.
